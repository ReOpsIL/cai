# **Agentic Coder — Product Definition & Specification**

## **1. Product Overview**

An **Agentic Coder** is an AI-powered software development assistant that autonomously plans, executes, and validates coding tasks within a controlled environment. It integrates with local and remote development tools, adapts to changing requirements, and uses structured feedback loops to refine its work until acceptance criteria are met.

The system is intended to **reduce manual coding effort** by handling routine implementation, debugging, and integration tasks, while keeping the human developer in control of scope and quality.

## **2. Core Capabilities**

| Capability                       | Description                                                                                            |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Natural Language Task Intake** | Accepts human-readable instructions and converts them into actionable plans.                           |
| **Dynamic Planning**             | Generates, updates, and reorders step-by-step plans in response to errors, new context, or user input. |
| **Tool Orchestration**           | Executes commands, edits code, applies patches, queries APIs, and integrates with developer tools.     |
| **Context-Aware Reasoning**      | Uses current project state (file structure, code snippets, test results) to inform decisions.          |
| **MCP Integration**              | Connects to Model Context Protocol servers for extended tools and data sources.                        |
| **Automated Validation**         | Runs tests, linters, build processes, or MCP-provided validators to confirm task completion.           |
| **Adaptive Subtasking**          | Splits work into smaller subtasks when necessary for clarity, correctness, or error resolution.        |

## **3. Operational Flow**

```
User Prompt → Plan Generation → Step Execution (Tools/MCP) 
→ Observation of Results → Plan Adjustment → Repeat Until Done
```

### **Step Details**

1. **Plan Generation**

    * LLM creates an initial *linear* plan (no native nested hierarchy).
    * Steps may be labeled for logical grouping (e.g., `1.1`, `1.2`).

2. **Execution**

    * Controlled by the agent, not a background scheduler.
    * Steps can include file edits, command execution, or MCP calls.
    * Changes are atomic: marked complete only after execution + verification.

3. **Feedback Loop**

    * Output from each step is analyzed.
    * Errors, unmet criteria, or missing context trigger re-planning.
    * The loop continues until all acceptance criteria are met or user stops execution.

4. **Validation**

    * Acceptance criteria defined by user, inferred from the task, or encoded in tests.
    * Evidence-driven: Only verified results are accepted as “done.”

## **4. Technical Architecture**

* **Core Engine:**

    * LLM-based reasoning module for planning and decision-making
    * Execution controller for tool orchestration
* **Tool Layer:**

    * Shell command runner
    * File editor/patch applier
    * MCP client for remote capabilities
* **Context Manager:**

    * Project scanner (directory structure, file content summaries)
    * State tracker for step completion and plan history
* **Validation Layer:**

    * Test runner (e.g., `cargo test`, `pytest`)
    * Linters, static analysis tools, and runtime output checkers

## **5. Modes of Operation**

| Mode          | Description                                                                                   |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Suggest**   | Proposes changes; requires explicit approval before execution.                                |
| **Auto Edit** | Applies file changes automatically; asks before running shell commands.                       |
| **Full Auto** | Executes file changes and commands autonomously in a sandboxed, network-disabled environment. |

## **6. Constraints & Limitations**

* **Flat Plan Structure:** No true hierarchical task trees; simulated via naming conventions.
* **No Continuous Autonomy:** Runs only during active sessions; does not persistently monitor projects.
* **MCP Dependency:** MCP servers provide capabilities but cannot execute tasks independently.
* **Token & Context Limits:** Large projects require summarization or selective file reads.
* **Human Oversight Required:** Best results occur when the user reviews, guides, and approves major steps.

---

## **7. Example Use Cases**

* Implementing a new feature based on user requirements.
* Refactoring legacy code with linting and tests.
* Debugging and fixing failing test cases.
* Integrating an API client into an existing codebase.
* Writing boilerplate or repetitive scaffolding code.

---

## **8. Target Users**

* Software engineers seeking automation for routine coding tasks.
* DevOps and platform engineers who need quick script/tool generation.
* QA teams that want AI-assisted test creation and maintenance.
* Educators demonstrating programming workflows.

## **9. Definition Statement**

> The **Agentic Coder** is an AI-driven coding collaborator that autonomously plans, executes, and validates software development tasks using a structured, feedback-driven loop. It interacts with the development environment through tool and MCP integrations, adapts its plan based on real-world results, and ensures task completion through explicit validation—while keeping the human developer in ultimate control.
