# Product Requirements Document (PRD) for CAI

## 1. Overview
### 1.1 Product Name
CAI (CLI Agentic Intelligence) - An agentic CLI coder tool built in Rust, utilizing the Grok API as its LLM backend.

### 1.2 Product Description
CAI is an advanced interactive command-line tool that embodies true agentic intelligence for software engineering tasks. Built with a sophisticated meta-cognitive reasoning framework, CAI operates at three distinct levels: task reasoning (understanding requirements and constraints), strategy reasoning (planning optimal approaches and assessing risks), and meta-reasoning (confidence tracking and adaptive strategy modification). The system employs advanced prompting strategies, multi-level error recovery, intelligent tool orchestration, and progressive learning patterns to autonomously handle complex coding workflows through natural language delegation.
