Okay, this is a great foundation for CAI! Let's brainstorm some enhancements, new features, and user stories to make it even more powerful and user-friendly.

Here's a comprehensive list:

**I. Enhancements to Existing Features:**

**A. Command System:**

*   **Enhancement Idea:** Command Chaining/Piping
    *   **User Story:** "As a developer, I want to pipe the output of `@list-files(*.md)` directly into a prompt for the LLM to summarize these files, so that I can quickly get an overview without manual copy-pasting."
    *   **Potential New/Modified Commands:** Introduce a pipe operator like `|` (e.g., `@list-files(*.md) | summarize these files`) or nested command execution. Alternatively, a command like `@pipe(<^uuid_of_command_output>, "prompt for LLM")`.

*   **Enhancement Idea:** Command Aliases
    *   **User Story:** "As a power user, I want to define aliases for frequently used complex commands or command sequences (e.g., alias `gencode` to `@set-model(gpt-4-turbo) @read-file(spec.txt) write code based on this spec:`) so that I can save typing and streamline my workflow."
    *   **Potential New/Modified Commands:** `@alias-set(alias_name, "command_string")`, `@alias-remove(alias_name)`, `@alias-list()`

*   **Enhancement Idea:** Asynchronous Command Execution & Job Management
    *   **User Story:** "As a researcher, I want to run a long-running command like `@process-batch(dataset/*.csv, "analyze trend")` in the background and continue interacting with CAI, so that my workflow isn't blocked."
    *   **Potential New/Modified Commands:** `@run-async(@command(...))`, `@jobs-list()`, `@job-status(job_id)`, `@job-kill(job_id)`

*   **Enhancement Idea:** Conditional Command Execution
    *   **User Story:** "As a content creator, I want to execute a command like `@export-summary(<^uuid>, summary.txt)` only if the LLM's previous response (referenced by <^uuid>) contains the keyword 'final', so that I can automate conditional actions based on LLM output."
    *   **Potential New/Modified Commands:** `@if-contains(<^uuid_or_text>, "keyword", @command_if_true(), @command_if_false())` (latter optional)

*   **Enhancement Idea:** Parameterized Prompts with Command Output
    *   **User Story:** "As a developer, I want to easily insert the output of a file read (`@read-file(README.md)`) or a previous LLM response directly into a new prompt string at a specific location, so that I can construct complex prompts programmatically."
    *   **Potential New/Modified Commands:** Enhanced prompt parsing to recognize placeholders like `{{<^uuid>}}` or `{{@read-file(path)}}` within the prompt string itself, which get substituted before sending to the LLM.

**B. Memory Management:**

*   **Enhancement Idea:** Named Conversation Sessions/Threads
    *   **User Story:** "As a researcher, I want to create and switch between named conversation sessions (e.g., 'project_alpha_analysis', 'literature_review_xyz') so that I can keep my different research contexts separate and organized without memory conflicts."
    *   **Potential New/Modified Commands:** `@session-start(name)`, `@session-switch(name)`, `@session-list()`, `@session-rename(old_name, new_name)`, `@session-close(name)`, `@session-export(session_name, filename)`

*   **Enhancement Idea:** Tagging and Searching Conversation History
    *   **User Story:** "As a content creator, I want to tag important messages with keywords (e.g., #idea, #todo, #reference) and then search my conversation history by these tags, so that I can quickly find relevant information later."
    *   **Potential New/Modified Commands:** `@tag-add(<^uuid>, tag_name)`, `@tag-remove(<^uuid>, tag_name)`, `@search-memory(query_string, --tags=tag1,tag2)`

*   **Enhancement Idea:** Conversation Summarization
    *   **User Story:** "As a developer, after a long debugging session with the LLM, I want to get an automatic summary of the key problems discussed and solutions proposed so that I can quickly refresh my memory or share it with colleagues."
    *   **Potential New/Modified Commands:** `@summarize-conversation(length=short|medium|long, from_uuid=optional, to_uuid=optional)` (This would likely use an LLM call).

*   **Enhancement Idea:** Selective Memory for LLM Context
    *   **User Story:** "As a power user, I want to explicitly select which previous messages (by UUID) are included in the context sent to the LLM for the next prompt, so that I can have fine-grained control over what the LLM 'remembers' and reduce token usage."
    *   **Potential New/Modified Commands:** `@with-context(<^uuid1>, <^uuid2>, "my new prompt")` or a mode where context is manually curated.

**C. File Operations:**

*   **Enhancement Idea:** In-place File Modification via LLM
    *   **User Story:** "As a developer, I want to tell the LLM to 'refactor the function X in `@read-file(code.py)`' and have CAI apply the suggested changes directly to `code.py` after my confirmation, so that I can iterate on code faster."
    *   **Potential New/Modified Commands:** `@edit-file(filename, "LLM instruction for editing")` (might involve diffing and applying patches).

*   **Enhancement Idea:** Directory Operations
    *   **User Story:** "As a content creator, I want to create a new project directory and then ask the LLM to generate a basic file structure within it (e.g., 'docs/', 'src/', 'README.md'), so that I can quickly bootstrap new projects."
    *   **Potential New/Modified Commands:** `@make-dir(path)`, `@remove-dir(path)`, `@list-tree(path)`

*   **Enhancement Idea:** Watch File/Directory for Changes
    *   **User Story:** "As a developer, I want to watch a log file for new error messages and automatically send them to the LLM for analysis so that I can get real-time insights into issues."
    *   **Potential New/Modified Commands:** `@watch-file(filename, "prompt to send on change or with new content")`, `@watch-stop(filename)`

**D. Model Selection:**

*   **Enhancement Idea:** Model Profiles/Aliases
    *   **User Story:** "As a user, I want to define profiles like 'coding_default' (e.g., gpt-4) and 'quick_summary' (e.g., a faster, cheaper model) and easily switch between them, so that I can optimize for task and cost without remembering specific model names."
    *   **Potential New/Modified Commands:** `@model-profile-set(profile_name, model_id, params...)`, `@model-profile-use(profile_name)`, `@model-profile-list()`

*   **Enhancement Idea:** Per-Command Model Override
    *   **User Story:** "As a developer, I want to use my default model for most tasks but occasionally specify a different model for a single command or prompt (e.g., `Analyze this image using a vision model: @process-with-model(claude-3-opus, @read-file(image.png))`) so that I have flexibility without changing global settings."
    *   **Potential New/Modified Commands:** Add an optional `model` parameter to prompts or commands that interact with LLMs: `My prompt here @llm-options(model=specific-model-id)`

*   **Enhancement Idea:** Cost Estimation/Tracking (OpenRouter specific)
    *   **User Story:** "As a budget-conscious user, I want to see an estimated cost before sending a prompt to an expensive model, or track my token usage and estimated costs per session/day so that I can manage my OpenRouter spending."
    *   **Potential New/Modified Commands:** `@estimate-cost("prompt text", model_id?)`, `@usage-stats(period=session|day|month)` (would require OpenRouter to provide necessary info or local calculation).

**E. Configuration:**

*   **Enhancement Idea:** Multiple Configuration Profiles
    *   **User Story:** "As a user working on different projects, I want to have separate configuration profiles (e.g., `work_project_cai.conf`, `personal_writing_cai.conf`) that I can load at startup, so that I can maintain distinct settings like default models, API keys (if supporting more than OpenRouter), and aliases."
    *   **Potential New/Modified Commands:** `cai --config personal_writing_cai.conf` (CLI arg), `@config-load(filepath)`, `@config-save-as(filepath)`

*   **Enhancement Idea:** Export/Import Configuration
    *   **User Story:** "As a team lead, I want to export my CAI configuration (model preferences, aliases, etc.) and share it with my team, so that we can have a consistent environment."
    *   **Potential New/Modified Commands:** `@config-export(filename)`, `@config-import(filename)`

**II. New Feature Areas:**

**A. Feature Area Name:** Scripting & Automation Engine

*   **Description:** Allows users to create, save, and execute scripts composed of CAI commands and LLM interactions to automate repetitive tasks or complex workflows.
*   **Key Capabilities:**
    *   Define sequences of commands.
    *   Use variables within scripts (e.g., set by command output, user input).
    *   Basic control flow (loops, conditionals based on command output or LLM response).
    *   Pass arguments to scripts.
    *   Save and load scripts from files.
*   **User Stories:**
    *   "As a developer, I want to write a script that reads a list of API endpoints from a file, generates test cases for each using an LLM, and saves them to separate files, so that I can automate test generation."
    *   "As a content creator, I want to create a script that takes a topic, queries the LLM for a blog post outline, then iteratively asks the LLM to expand each section, incorporating outputs from `@read-file` for research material, so that I can streamline my writing process."
    *   "As a researcher, I want to script a workflow that processes multiple data files, sends statistical summaries to an LLM for interpretation, and then exports the findings along with the LLM's analysis, so that I can automate parts of my data analysis pipeline."
*   **Potential New Commands:** `@script-run(script_name_or_file, arg1, arg2)`, `@script-define(script_name)`, `@script-save(script_name, filename)`, `@script-load(filename)`, internal script commands like `@set-var(name, value_or_@command_output)`, `@loop(count_or_condition)`, `@if(...)`

**B. Feature Area Name:** Advanced Context Management & Knowledge Injection

*   **Description:** Provides more sophisticated ways to manage and inject local knowledge into LLM conversations beyond simple file reads or full history.
*   **Key Capabilities:**
    *   Create and manage "context bundles" (collections of file paths, specific memory UUIDs, URLs to scrape).
    *   Pin important messages or files to the current conversation context.
    *   Dynamically inject context bundles into prompts.
    *   Summarize large context before injection to save tokens.
*   **User Stories:**
    *   "As a developer troubleshooting a bug, I want to create a context bundle with relevant source code files, error logs, and previous LLM suggestions, and then easily inject this bundle when asking new questions, so the LLM has all necessary information without me re-pasting it."
    *   "As a researcher, I want to pin a core research paper (as a file or summarized text) to my current session's context, so that all my subsequent prompts to the LLM are implicitly aware of this foundational document."
    *   "As a content writer, I want to quickly inject the content of several related articles I've previously written or web pages I've scraped into the prompt when asking the LLM to synthesize a new piece, so it can draw upon that specific knowledge."
*   **Potential New Commands:** `@context-bundle-create(name)`, `@context-bundle-add(bundle_name, item_type=file|uuid|url, item_value)`, `@context-bundle-list()`, `@pin-context(item_type=file|uuid, item_value)`, `@unpin-context(item_value)`, `@prompt-with-bundle(bundle_name, "My prompt text")`

**C. Feature Area Name:** Plugin System & Extensibility

*   **Description:** Allows users or third-party developers to create and integrate custom commands and functionalities into CAI, expanding its capabilities.
*   **Key Capabilities:**
    *   Well-defined API for plugins to register new commands.
    *   Ability for plugins to interact with CAI's core systems (memory, file I/O, LLM calls).
    *   Loading plugins from local directories or potentially a central repository.
    *   Managing (enable/disable/list) installed plugins.
*   **User Stories:**
    *   "As a developer working with a specific API (e.g., GitHub), I want to install or create a plugin that adds commands like `@github-get-issue(repo, id)` or `@github-create-pr(...)` so I can interact with these services directly from CAI."
    *   "As a data scientist, I want to develop a plugin that adds commands for specific data processing libraries (e.g., `@pandas-describe(@read-file(data.csv))`) so I can integrate my custom data tools into the LLM workflow."
    *   "As a power user, I want to browse a list of community-contributed plugins and easily install ones that extend CAI for specialized tasks like database interaction or image manipulation, so I can tailor CAI to my needs."
*   **Potential New Commands:** `@plugin-install(source_url_or_path)`, `@plugin-list()`, `@plugin-enable(plugin_name)`, `@plugin-disable(plugin_name)`, `@plugin-update(plugin_name)`

**D. Feature Area Name:** Local Knowledge Base Indexing & Retrieval (RAG-light)

*   **Description:** Enables CAI to index local directories of documents (text, markdown, code) and use this index to find and inject relevant snippets into LLM prompts, providing context from local data.
*   **Key Capabilities:**
    *   Command to create/update an index for a specified directory.
    *   Command to search the index and retrieve relevant chunks of text.
    *   Automatically inject top search results into LLM prompts when a specific command is used or a flag is set.
*   **User Stories:**
    *   "As a technical writer managing a large documentation set, I want to index my docs folder and then ask CAI, 'How do I configure feature X? @use-kb(docs_index)', so that it retrieves relevant sections from my local files to answer the question."
    *   "As a developer, I want to index my project's codebase and then ask the LLM, 'Explain the purpose of the `UserManager` class @use-kb(project_src_index)', so it can find and use the class definition and related comments for its explanation."
    *   "As a researcher, I want to index a folder of PDF papers (after converting to text) and query it with `@search-kb(papers_index, "studies on topic Y")` to find relevant papers and then use their content to prompt the LLM for a literature review."
*   **Potential New Commands:** `@kb-index-create(name, path_to_directory, --filetypes=*.md,*.txt)`, `@kb-index-update(name)`, `@kb-index-list()`, `@kb-search(index_name, "query string", --top_k=3)`, `@prompt-with-kb(index_name, "My prompt using knowledge base for: query string")`

**III. Cross-Cutting Concerns & UX Improvements:**

*   **Suggestion:** Enhanced Interactive Help & Command Autocompletion
    *   **User Story:** "As a new user, I want comprehensive, context-aware help within the CLI (e.g., `@help(command-name)` showing detailed usage, examples) and tab-completion for commands and their known parameters, so that I can learn and use CAI more efficiently."

*   **Suggestion:** Richer Output Formatting
    *   **User Story:** "As a developer, when an LLM generates code, I want it to be syntax-highlighted in the terminal, and when it generates tables, I want them to be formatted nicely, so that the output is easier to read and understand."
    *   **Potential Implementation:** Markdown rendering in the terminal, or options for output format.

*   **Suggestion:** Interactive Command Refinement / "Did you mean?"
    *   **User Story:** "As a user, if I mistype a command or provide incorrect parameters, I want CAI to suggest corrections or guide me through fixing it, so that I don't get frustrated by simple errors."

*   **Suggestion:** Improved Conversation History Visualization (beyond `@get-memory`)
    *   **User Story:** "As a researcher, I want a command to view my current session's conversation history in a more structured way, perhaps with options to filter by speaker (user/AI) or see a threaded view if that becomes relevant, so I can easily review the flow of interaction."
    *   **Potential New Commands:** `@show-history(--tree, --limit=N, --filter=user|ai)`

*   **Suggestion:** Status Bar/Persistent Information Display
    *   **User Story:** "As a frequent user, I want a configurable status line at the bottom or top of my CAI interface showing the current model, session name, token count for the last interaction, or other relevant info, so I always have key context visible."

*   **Suggestion:** Clearer Cost/Token Usage Feedback
    *   **User Story:** "As a user, after each LLM interaction, I want to see the token count used (prompt + completion) and, if possible, an estimated cost for that specific interaction, so I can be more mindful of my usage."

This list provides a broad range of ideas. The next step would be to prioritize them based on user needs, development effort, and how well they align with CAI's core vision. Good luck with CAI – it sounds like a very promising tool!
