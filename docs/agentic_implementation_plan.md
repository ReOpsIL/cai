# Implementation Plan for Agentic Logic in CAI

## 1. Overview
The agentic logic in CAI enables autonomous, multi-step task execution using the Grok API as the LLM backend. This implementation follows a comprehensive meta-cognitive framework that operates at three distinct reasoning levels: task reasoning (understanding requirements), strategy reasoning (planning approaches), and meta-reasoning (confidence assessment and strategy adaptation). The system incorporates advanced prompting strategies, multi-level error recovery, intelligent context management, and progressive learning patterns to handle complex coding tasks via CLI.

## 2. Core Architecture Components

### 2.1 Meta-Cognitive Reasoning Engine
- **Three-Layer Reasoning System**:
  - Level 1 (Task): Requirement analysis, constraint identification, dependency mapping
  - Level 2 (Strategy): Approach selection, action sequencing, risk assessment
  - Level 3 (Meta): Confidence tracking, strategy adaptation, learning integration
- **Hierarchical Goal Decomposition**: Break complex tasks into manageable sub-goals with dynamic re-planning capabilities
- **Hypothesis-Driven Development**: Maintain active hypotheses with evidence tracking and confidence calibration

### 2.2 Advanced Agent Core
- **Self-Questioning Framework**: Implement before/during/after action reflection cycles
- **Context-Aware Processing**: Progressive context building with mental model maintenance
- **Adaptive Response Parsing**: Support for multiple output formats (JSON, XML) with fallback strategies
- **Dynamic Planning Engine**: Real-time plan adjustment based on execution results and new discoveries

### 2.3 Intelligent Tool Orchestration
- **Smart Tool Selection**: Decision trees for optimal tool choice based on context and confidence levels
- **Progressive Tool Use**: Layered validation from syntax to system-level verification
- **Parallel Execution**: Async tool coordination using Tokio for performance optimization
- **Tool Impact Analysis**: Predict and track changes across the codebase

### 2.4 Advanced State Management
- **Mental Model Maintenance**: JSON-structured system understanding including architecture patterns, conventions, and constraints
- **Progressive Context Building**: Four-phase discovery process from reconnaissance to deep contextual understanding
- **Change Impact Tracking**: Multi-dimensional impact assessment (direct, indirect, testing, documentation, deployment)
- **Session Learning**: Pattern recognition, anti-pattern detection, and confidence calibration

## 3. Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation & Framework Design (Week 1)
