- Add configuration file (if not exists) named ~/cai.conf, when cai app loads it should read all settings from ~/cai.conf configuration file.
- Configuration file should include all sorts of attributes and settings that ALL cai code will use. Do NOT save openrouter API key in configuration file or other user secret information.
- Add command @set-model [*gemini*free*] - cai will list available models in openrouter. The command will receive an optional model name wild card and list only models that match wild card. The command will add a model number before each model and the user will be able to choose a model from the list, cai will wait for input from the user. The input should be a model number only. If the user will press escape or the input will be empty (pressing enter without number/value) then no model will be selected.
if the user will provide a model index (from the list) cai will use the selected model (eg by using model name from teh list) and save the selected model name for future use in ~/cai.conf configuration file. Do not earse ~/cai.conf - just update relevant attribute and save.
- Genrate a documents in docs/cai.md with description of current features and functionality implemented in source code


- split main.rs into modules
  * History module - for handling prompt history - saveing, loading, listing, searching
  * Configuration module - for handling configuration loading and saving
  * Command handle - for hanlding commands.
  * Commands modules - each @[command] should have its own module for source code clarity

Hereâ€™s a rephrased and clearer version of your task list:

---
- add module "files" that will handle the following files commands:
  * @list-files [wildcard]: will list files recusivly that matches wildcard
  * @list-folders [wildcard]: will list folders recusivly that matches wildcard
  * @read-file [memory-id] [filename]": will read a single file into chat module in a hashmap with key provided by the user "memory-id" 
  * @read-files [memory-id] [wildcard]: will read all files that matches wildcard into chat module in a hashmap with key provided by the user "memory-id" 
  * @read-folder [memory-id] [wildcard]: will read all files from folders that matches wildcard into chat module in a hashmap with key provided by the user "memory-id" 
  
- chat module should handle th folowing commands:
  * @reset-context: will reset chat memory hashmap - This will earash all items in hashmap
  * @save-context [file-name]: will dump hashmap content  into file name provided by the user.
  
- parse chat for commands:
  * if the user types a command prefix in the prompt (eg. hey I want you to @read-files my-features feature_a*.md and extend each feature.  )
