# Deep Dive: Agentic Coding Architecture

## 1. Core Agentic Reasoning Framework

### The Meta-Cognitive Layer
The agent operates with multiple levels of reasoning:

**Level 1: Task Reasoning**
- What am I trying to accomplish?
- What are the technical requirements?
- What are the constraints and dependencies?

**Level 2: Strategy Reasoning**
- How should I approach this problem?
- What's the optimal sequence of actions?
- What are the risks of each approach?

**Level 3: Meta-Reasoning**
- How confident am I in my current approach?
- Should I change strategies based on new information?
- What have I learned that updates my understanding?

### Planning Architecture

**Hierarchical Goal Decomposition**
```
Primary Goal: "Add user authentication to the app"
├── Sub-goal 1: Set up authentication middleware
│   ├── Task: Install passport.js
│   ├── Task: Configure session management
│   └── Task: Create auth routes
├── Sub-goal 2: Create user model and database
│   ├── Task: Design user schema
│   ├── Task: Set up database connection
│   └── Task: Create migration files
└── Sub-goal 3: Implement frontend auth UI
    ├── Task: Create login/signup forms
    ├── Task: Add auth state management
    └── Task: Implement route protection
```

**Dynamic Re-planning**
The agent continuously updates its plan based on:
- Execution results
- New discoveries about the codebase
- Unexpected errors or complications
- User feedback or clarifications

## 2. Advanced Prompting Strategies

### Self-Questioning Frameworks

**Before Taking Action:**
```
"Let me think through this step:
1. What exactly am I trying to achieve with this change?
2. How does this fit into the larger goal?
3. What files/components will this affect?
4. What could break as a result?
5. How will I verify this worked?
6. Is there a simpler approach I'm missing?"
```

**During Problem-Solving:**
```
"I'm encountering [specific issue]. Let me analyze:
- What is the root cause vs. symptoms?
- What assumptions did I make that might be wrong?
- What information do I need to gather?
- What are 3 different approaches I could try?
- Which approach has the lowest risk?"
```

**After Each Action:**
```
"Evaluating the result:
- Did this accomplish what I intended?
- What side effects occurred?
- What new information did I learn?
- Should I continue with the current plan or adjust?
- What's the next most logical step?"
```

### Context-Aware Prompting

**File Reading Strategy:**
```
"I need to understand the codebase structure. I'll:
1. Read the main entry points (package.json, main.js, index.html)
2. Identify the architecture pattern (MVC, component-based, etc.)
3. Map out the key directories and their purposes
4. Understand the build/deployment setup
5. Identify existing patterns and conventions to follow"
```

**Dependency Analysis:**
```
"Before making changes to [file], I need to understand:
- What other files import from this module?
- What external dependencies does this rely on?
- Are there any circular dependencies?
- What are the input/output contracts I need to maintain?"
```

## 3. Error Recovery & Adaptive Reasoning

### Multi-Level Error Handling

**Syntax/Runtime Errors:**
```
Error Detection → Root Cause Analysis → Fix Generation → Verification
│
├── If fix works: Continue with plan
├── If fix fails: Try alternative approach
└── If multiple failures: Re-evaluate entire strategy
```

**Logical Errors:**
```
"The code runs but doesn't behave as expected. I need to:
1. Identify specific test cases that fail
2. Trace through the execution path
3. Compare expected vs. actual behavior
4. Hypothesize about the mismatch
5. Design targeted fixes
6. Test incrementally"
```

**Integration Errors:**
```
"My change broke something else in the system:
1. Identify what broke and how
2. Understand the coupling I didn't anticipate
3. Decide: revert and try differently, or fix the breakage
4. Update my mental model of the system
5. Adjust future plans to account for this coupling"
```

### Hypothesis-Driven Development

**Forming Hypotheses:**
```
"I believe the issue is caused by [specific cause] because:
- Evidence 1: [observation]
- Evidence 2: [pattern]
- Evidence 3: [prior experience]

To test this hypothesis, I will:
- Make minimal change X
- Observe result Y
- If Y occurs, hypothesis confirmed
- If not, consider alternative hypothesis Z"
```

**Hypothesis Tracking:**
The agent maintains a running log of:
- Current active hypotheses
- Evidence for/against each
- Confidence levels
- Next tests to run

## 4. Advanced Context Management

### Mental Model Maintenance

**System Understanding:**
```json
{
  "architecture": "React + Express + MongoDB",
  "key_patterns": {
    "state_management": "Redux with RTK",
    "styling": "CSS modules",
    "routing": "React Router v6"
  },
  "conventions": {
    "file_naming": "camelCase for components, kebab-case for utilities",
    "folder_structure": "feature-based organization",
    "imports": "absolute imports from src/"
  },
  "constraints": {
    "no_external_api_calls": "all data from local state",
    "accessibility": "WCAG 2.1 AA compliance required",
    "performance": "bundle size must stay under 500KB"
  }
}
```

**Change Impact Tracking:**
```
"I'm about to modify the authentication logic. This will impact:
- Direct: login/logout flows, protected routes
- Indirect: user state management, session persistence
- Testing: auth-related unit tests, integration tests
- Documentation: API docs, user guides
- Deployment: environment variables, security configs"
```

### Progressive Context Building

**Discovery Process:**
```
Phase 1: High-level reconnaissance
- Scan package.json for tech stack
- Read README for setup instructions
- Identify main entry points

Phase 2: Architecture mapping
- Understand folder structure
- Identify key abstractions/patterns
- Map data flow and state management

Phase 3: Deep contextual understanding
- Read relevant source files
- Understand existing implementations
- Identify extension points and conventions

Phase 4: Change planning
- Plan modifications that fit the existing patterns
- Identify potential integration points
- Anticipate necessary updates across the codebase
```

## 5. Tool Use Orchestration

### Smart Tool Selection

**Decision Trees for Tool Use:**
```
Need to understand code behavior?
├── Is it a small, pure function? → Read and analyze mentally
├── Is it complex with side effects? → Add logging/debugging
├── Is it a user interaction? → Run the application
└── Is it a data transformation? → Write quick test

Need to make changes?
├── High confidence in approach? → Make direct changes
├── Uncertain about impact? → Create branch/backup first
├── Complex refactoring needed? → Break into smaller steps
└── External dependencies involved? → Check compatibility first
```

**Progressive Tool Use:**
```
Level 1: Read files to understand current state
Level 2: Run existing tests to verify understanding
Level 3: Make minimal changes to test approach
Level 4: Implement full solution incrementally
Level 5: Run comprehensive tests and validation
```

### Verification Strategies

**Multi-layered Validation:**
```
1. Syntax validation: Does the code parse correctly?
2. Type validation: Do types match expected contracts?
3. Unit validation: Do individual functions work correctly?
4. Integration validation: Do components work together?
5. System validation: Does the full application behave correctly?
6. User validation: Does this solve the original problem?
```

## 6. Learning and Adaptation Patterns

### Session-Level Learning

**Pattern Recognition:**
```
"I notice that in this codebase:
- Async operations always use try/catch with specific error handling
- Components follow a particular prop validation pattern
- State updates trigger specific side effects
- Testing follows a particular mocking strategy

I should follow these patterns in my changes."
```

**Anti-pattern Detection:**
```
"I tried approach X but it failed because:
- It violated the existing architecture principles
- It created unexpected coupling
- It broke existing functionality
- It didn't account for edge cases Y and Z

I won't try this approach again in similar contexts."
```

### Confidence Calibration

**Confidence Tracking:**
```
"For this change, my confidence levels are:
- Understanding the requirement: 90%
- Understanding the current code: 75%
- Chosen approach correctness: 85%
- Implementation quality: 80%
- Impact assessment: 60%

Given low confidence in impact assessment, I should:
- Make smaller, more incremental changes
- Add more comprehensive testing
- Review related code more thoroughly"
```

## 7. Advanced Reasoning Patterns

### Analogical Reasoning

**Pattern Matching:**
```
"This problem is similar to how authentication was handled in the login component:
- Same need for state management
- Same error handling patterns
- Same user feedback requirements

I can adapt that pattern here with modifications for:
- Different data structure
- Different validation rules
- Different UI requirements"
```

### Counterfactual Reasoning

**Alternative Exploration:**
```
"What if I had chosen approach B instead of approach A?
- Pros: Simpler implementation, fewer dependencies
- Cons: Less flexible, harder to extend later
- Risk assessment: Lower short-term risk, higher long-term risk

Given the project requirements prioritize maintainability,
approach A is still the better choice despite higher complexity."
```

### Causal Reasoning

**Root Cause Analysis:**
```
"The test is failing because:
1. The component isn't rendering the expected element
2. This happens because the props aren't being passed correctly
3. Props aren't passed because the parent component logic changed
4. Parent logic changed because I modified the state structure
5. State structure changed to accommodate the new feature

Therefore, I need to update the prop-passing logic in the parent."
```

## 8. Integration with Development Workflow

### Version Control Integration

**Commit Strategy Reasoning:**
```
"I've made several related changes. I should commit them as:
- Commit 1: Refactor existing auth logic (safe, reversible)
- Commit 2: Add new authentication method (new feature)
- Commit 3: Update tests for new functionality (verification)

This allows for easier rollback if any step causes issues."
```

### Testing Integration

**Test-Driven Development Loop:**
```
1. Understand requirement
2. Write failing test that captures requirement
3. Implement minimal code to make test pass
4. Refactor while keeping tests green
5. Add edge case tests
6. Handle edge cases in implementation
7. Validate full integration
```

### Documentation Integration

**Self-Documenting Changes:**
```
"As I make these changes, I need to update:
- Inline code comments for complex logic
- Function/class documentation
- README if new dependencies added
- API documentation if interfaces change
- Migration guide if breaking changes introduced"
```

This comprehensive framework enables truly agentic behavior by combining systematic reasoning, adaptive learning, and intelligent tool orchestration. The key is maintaining explicit models of goals, plans, and confidence levels while continuously updating them based on new information and results.
